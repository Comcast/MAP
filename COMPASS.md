COMPASS is a questionnaire developed from MAP personas so that threat modelers can ask specific, targeted questions. Each question is linked to a persona. Before diving into privacy threats, the following scoping questions might be helpful during a threat modeling session. This is because the existence of personal information must be known, even if it is managed and is not a threat. Team must ensure that these are properly handled when they exist, and reviews are done for special categories of such information.

| Scoping Questions | 
|---|
| Does the   application code contain personal information?  |
| Do any   databases used by the application contain personal information? If the   application has personal information, has it been de-deidentified?  |
| Do any   application logs contain personal information?   |


| Special categories of PI | 
|---|
| **Biometric   data**: Does the application collect biometric data?  General guidelines: Biometric data   (fingerprints, retina scans, etc.) require explicit notice and written   consent from customers before collection. Such data can also not be sent to   third-parties, monetized, or retained without consent.  |
|  **Children   data**: Does the application collect data from youth   under 16? General guidelines: Data collected from children   require explicit notice and written consent from parents/guardians (for users   under 13 years) or children (for users between 13-16 years).  Such data can also not be sent to   third-parties, monetized, or retained without consent. Privacy settings   should be easy to understand for children. If the child is being tracked by   an adult through the application, the child should be notified (for example,   a green LED light can indicate that a camera is switched on). |
| **CPNI**: Does the application contain CPNI data?  General guidelines: The use of CPNI data is   limited to specific purposes. It cannot be used for marketing that a customer   has not opted into.  |
|  **Voice and   Video**: Does the application collect voice or video   data?      General guidelines: Voice data cannot be used   for advertisement purposes, even if collected by or for a third-party   partner. Organization must have an individualâ€™s prior, written permission before   collecting or recording any audiovisual or other sensor data from within   their dwelling. For both video and voice data, specific consent obligations  must be met. |

<h2> COMPASS Questionnaire </h2>
The threats are categorized by FIPS (Fair Information Practice Principles), the principles which guide privacy regulation, developed in 1974. This makes it easy to understand which threat category a question falls under.
